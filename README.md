# Air-quality-AQI
Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health today. This project focuses on building a machine learning–based Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction system using the Random Forest algorithm. The model predicts the AQI value based on environmental parameters and identifies whether the air is good, moderate, or unhealthy.
